Conspiracy theories run the gamut from ludicrous, to plausible, to actually being confirmed as true. There are enough examples of something that was once considered a \"conspiracy theory\" turning out to be actually true to give credence to the possible validity of new conspiracy theories, at least in some people's minds. For example, MK Ultra. The idea that the US government and CIA were conducting experiments on ESP, telekinesis, mind-control, and using powerful hallucinogens on their own citizens was considered a crazy conspiracy theory for a long time. Come to find out 60 years later or so that much of it was actually true.\n\nSecond, we need to agree that people can be motivated or influenced to believe in a certain conspiracy for many different reasons. One reason can be, and often is, that the person lacks basic skills of logic, deduction, or understanding. However, that is not the only case. Since we have already shown that some conspiracy theories actually were true, then it is possible that the people who believed in those conspiracies believed because they had \\*superior\\* understanding of things compared to the masses. It is also possible that they still lacked understanding and just happened to be on the correct side by pure chance. My point here is that whether a conspiracy turns out to be true or not true, a person can believe in it for good reasons (that they have superior understanding, logic, evidence, etc) or for bad reasons (they lack basic logic and understanding).

So I would say this factor is a combination of information and realistic self knowledge about how informed you are relative to the sources you read.\n\nBut there is another factor besides knowledge of the field which determines your ability to accurately assess whether or not a conspiracy is happening. I would call this factor understanding of statistics and psychology. It is often very possible to analyze the numbers of an issue without actually knowing the issue. In the scientific method, this would be the \"record and analyze data\" step. So it is sort of science, but the easiest, most routine part of the science. For instance, with covid, we have a ton of numbers about how many cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc, have been recorded for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. You don't have to know anything about what's in the vaccines to calculate whether they are beating the null hypothesis.\n\nI suppose a third factor would be deciding which source's numbers to honor in the first place and which to discard.  And then there's looking at those stats and making a common sense guess about whether people even have enough motivation to keep the conspiracy going. If you don't trust authority at all, then this all breaks down because you can only talk about the numbers if you can agree which numbers to talk about.

While a quadratic rise in cases would be scary, an exponential rise is exponentially scarier, pardon the pun, because exponental growth becomes faster than any polynomial. I apologise for all the maths in advance. \n\nThe number of cases can be approximated by the equation dN\/ft = kN i.e. the rate of new cases is proportional to the number of number of cases. Which has the solution N=A*(exp(kt)), where A depends on the initial number of cases, k is the rate of new cases (R0\/ length of infection) and t is time. \n\nIf cases were given by a different equation say, d^2 N\/dt^2 =k, the change of rate of cases per day increases constantly you would have a quadratic rise in cases over time (N=1\/2*kt^2 +at+b), where a and b are constants given by the initial conditions. This equation should look like the acceleration of an object under constant acceleration and will have ever increasing cases with rate of new cases ever increasing, as we kind of expect, but will not be exponential. \n\nAs a side note you can check that these solutions are correct by substituting them into the equations. \n\nEdit: equations for clarity some grammatical mistakes.\n\nI'd like to add that exponential growth can be unintuitive at first.

To solve this, we just need better enforcement. People get pulled over for headlights that are burned, they should also get pulled over for unaligned headlights.\n\nRealigning headlights is an easy procedure in most cars. Takes about 20 mins if you've never done it before. 10 if you know how. \n\n2: Headlight plastic gets foggy over time, which causes the light to scatter more, causing even a properly aligned headlight to shine where it's not supposed to. To fix this, people should repolish their headlights when they start getting too foggy. The procedure takes about 30 mins if you have the proper equipment, and doesn't require much. It should be a normal maintenance item like an oil change, except you'd have to do it less often, and it'd be cheaper.\n\nThe reason you didn't notice this issue before is that headlights used to be made of glass, which doesn't oxidize and fog over time. Now they're made of plastic, and that becomes less clear over time due to exposure to uv and oxidation. Fortunately, the problem is usually limited to the surface, so a simple sanding and polishing fixes the problem (I've done this myself). \n\n3: Trucks are becoming bigger and taller, making even properly aligned headlights shine over the height of peoples eyes in traffic.\n\nTo fix this, there should be regulations on the height you're allowed to mount the headlights. If you want a huge truck, you'll have to live with weirdly placed low headlights. Current big trucks just have their headlights too high.\n\nAgain, trucks didn't used to be so big, so this didn't used to be a problem.

If you're using low beams it's said that you have 180ft of vision and that based on reaction time and stopping speed you'd only be able to travel \\~40MPH or you'd be over-drive your lights. Clearly cars may be better at stopping than they used to be so perhaps the \\~64ft feet to stop from 40MPH (just the time it takes the breaks to slow the vehicle - just over a second) is no longer valid. However, it certainly highlights the need for better lights as at night I'm driving between 75 to 85 mph. So I'd need approximately 530 ft to stop but the brights only show about 350ft of view meaning we need ever brighter lights on cars. So both my dims and my brights need to give a larger field of view because the majority of the miles I drive are well above those two fields of vision that the headlights provide.  \n\n\nI do have good news OP, recently there is a requirement that automakers use adaptive driving beams for cars made after 2023 which should help some of those oncoming lights as the light sent at the oncoming vehicle will be shut off at the region above the oncoming car's headlights.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":69.5249130939,"Ethos_Class":23.1749710313,"Pathos_Class":6.7217728853,"id":20526,"numPersuasive":650,"numTotal":974},{"body":"**[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Federal_Motor_Vehicle_Safety_Standard_108)** \n \n >Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 (FMVSS 108) regulates all automotive lighting, signalling and reflective devices in the United States.
