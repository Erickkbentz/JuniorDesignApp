I was a strict vegetarian  for 7 years and I had some sever consequences from it. I had absorption issues for various vitamins and dangerously low iron no matter how much supplements I was given. A lot of vitamins and minerals depend on each other to work properly and supplements are often synthesized to be cost effective and don't function properly in the body.

The horrid conditions, speed of processing, constant recalls from contamination, not to mention the amount of plastic and styrofoam  packaging  being utilized. None of these are about being a meat eater, all those issues are regarding big companies taking over and destroying smaller farms. And the fact is if you support grocery stores those issues will always be there. Money speaks volumes, and knowing where your money goes is what changes the world. \n\nIn terms of the actual farming of animals, the large scale of farming is the issue, not the animals themselves. Feeding 10,000 cows isn't the issue, it's feeding 10,000 cows in one spot. When one farmer grazes 100 cows on pasture, the cows are happy. When one farmer has 10,000 they need to feed them corn because grass isn't an option. Cows struggle to digest corn and it directly causes excess methane build up in the cow.

They're significantly less cruel than factory farming or even \"free range\" commerical eggs. \n\nThey do still have issues though. For any remotely efficient egg laying to happen two things need to be true: \n\n1.\tMale chicks need to be disposed of, roosters don't lay eggs. Typically done by throwing them live into a macerator or gassing. Not done at the \"backyard\u201d level but part of the process to get those laying hens.\n2.\t \"Older\" hens that lay fewer or no eggs need to be disposed of. Typically well before their natural life expectancy.\n\nThat's not even considering the health implications of breeding chickens to lay way more eggs than they naturally would, or the health implications of egg consumption on humans. There are 1000s of delicious foods out there that don't have any of these issues, I'll just stick with them.\n\nIt's also interesting to me how people will latch on to one part of veganism they disagree with or one vegan they don't like as a way to justify horrible treatment of animals.

You\u2019re right that vegan perspectives can seem extreme at first, since the way we view, treat, and use animals is so normalized in our society and such a prevalent part of our culture that we are desensitized to it- a perspective that challenges all of that can seem really strange at first. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by things that might happen but never actually do, since the problems mentioned are mainly just the most basic issues associated with using chickens for eggs. I\u2019m sure you do spoil your chickens, but as the video explained, the exploitative nature of chicken keeping comes from the generations of breeding that have gone into creating the chickens we keep today. It\u2019s not something you did wrong, and no amount of proper care can change it- it\u2019s just part of how those animals came to exist in their current state. Also, unless your chickens are all rescues from the egg industry (which is unlikely since rescues typically don\u2019t lay many eggs anymore) you or someone else bought those chickens (or eggs, if you bought them as eggs) from someone else, who is very likely to have engaged in a lot of the harmful practices associated with breeding chickens. That is the first issue the video mentioned- when we buy animals and their secretions, we are supporting harm and exploitation up the line, even if we ourselves try to do all the right things. \n\nYou could definitely make a case that backyard chicken keeping is not as horrifically cruel as the farms that supply the egg industry, and I think most vegans would agree with you. But there are legitimate reasons why vegans oppose it, and, if nothing else, it still perpetuates the idea that we are entitled to own and use animals\u2019 bodies as we see fit, which creates a lot of harmful implications and makes it that much easier for more extreme forms of exploitation to continue unchecked.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":24.5248313918,"Ethos_Class":42.9184549356,"Pathos_Class":31.47309626,"id":317,"numPersuasive":783,"numTotal":865},{"body":"Ooo so you are worried about animals losing their land?
